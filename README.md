The following is the code to a MIPS 5-Stage Datapath Processor with both forwarding and hazard detection. Branches are resolved in the excution stage.
You can find the necessary constraint, simulation and design sources in their appropriate folder.

Can execute the following instructions : 

add

addi

sub

mul    multiply

lw

sw

sb    store byte

lh    load half

lb    load byte

sh    store half

bgez

beq

bne

bgtz

blez

bltz

j

jr    jump register

jal

and

andi

or

nor

xor

xori

sll

srl

slt

slti



READ THIS -- Before Using

Convert MIPS .text code into Hexadecimal. Input Hexadecimal code into instruction memory.

Convert MIPS .data code into Hexadecimal. Input Hexadecimal code into data memory.

You can now run simulations of the datapath. The code to program the FPGA board is also availble.
